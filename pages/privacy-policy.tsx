        <h1 className="h2 mt-2">Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>Here at DEVERO.io Limited ("DEVERO.io", "we" or "us"), we take your privacy seriously. We're committed to protecting the privacy of any personal information you give us and we will comply with all relevant data protection legislation and related applicable Czech legislation.</p>

        <p>For the purposes of relevant data protection legislation, DEVERO.io Limited is the data controller of personal information we hold and process about you. We are registered on the public register of data controllers maintained by the Information Commissioner in the Czech. See the "Talk to us" section at the end of this Privacy Policy for details of how to contact us.</p>

        <p>We have a philosophy here about the way we use your data you share with us and the way that we communicate with you. If you hear from us, we will always aim to be respectful, relevant and appropriate. If at any time you don't feel we've lived up to our philosophy, please let us know straight away by getting in touch with us through the Contact Us page of DEVERO.io.</p>

        <p>Please take the time to read this Privacy Policy as it is important for you to understand how we collect and use your data when you use DEVERO.io. This policy explains how we collect, use and store the personal information you provide to us. 'Personal information' is data that relates to you and that identifies or can be used to identify you – this might be your name, email address, or other digital identifiers relating to you, such as cookies, IP addresses or logs.</p>

        <p>This policy may change from time to time and, if it does, the up-to-date version will always be available on the DEVERO.io site. Please make sure that you are aware of the latest version of this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>We are proud to give you access to DEVERO.io and, in return, we may collect, use and share your personal information as is necessary for us to make the website available in accordance with the Terms and Conditions and to give you the best user experience. We will only use personal information for our purposes in a manner permitted by relevant data protection legislation.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Cookie Policy</h2>

        <p>We use cookies to improve your experience on our site, DEVERO.io, and to recommend content that may be of interest to you. You can find out more below about what cookies are, the cookies we use and how to switch them off.</p>

        <p>You can indicate your acceptance to our use of cookies in accordance with this policy by clicking “OK” in the appropriate place on the banner that appears on DEVERO.io. However, please note that if you do not click “OK” but continue to browse the site, you will be deemed to have accepted our use of cookies (and what we use them for) in accordance with this Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">What are cookies?</h2>

        <p>A cookie is a text file containing small amounts of information which is downloaded to your device when you access a website. The text file is then sent back to our server each time your browser requests a page from the server. This enables us to operate the site more effectively and load the site so that it reflects your personal preferences, based on your previous browsing on DEVERO.io as well as keywords we may be able to gather from URLs of other webpages from which you accessed DEVERO.io. Cookies can also allow us to do various other things, as explained below.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">What cookies do we use?</h2>

        <p>When you visit DEVERO.io, the following types of cookies may be downloaded to your device:</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Analytical and Performance Cookies</h2>

        <p>We may use analytics service providers for website traffic analysis and reporting. Analytics service providers generate statistical and other information about the use of DEVERO.io by using cookies. They allow us to recognise and count the number of visitors and to see how often visitors return to the site, how long they stay and how visitors move around our site when they are using it. This helps us to improve the way our site works, for example, it helps users to find what they are looking for easily. The information generated relating to the site may be used to create reports about the use of the site and the analytics service provider will store this information.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Advertising and Targeting Cookies</h2>

        <p>These cookies record your visit to DEVERO.io, the pages you have visited and the links you have followed to other sites. We will use this information to try and make our site and other sites that you visit more relevant to your interests. We may also share this information with others, such as other DEVERO companies and carefully selected third parties, for this purpose.</p>

        <p>We work with technology partners to support our website and to provide you with relevant information about the products and services of other DEVERO companies both on DEVERO.io and on affiliated sites or sites within the advertising networks we work with. We may use cookies on our site to help us to place relevant DEVERO company advertising on third party websites when you visit those sites. If you are not happy for us to do this, please see the section of this policy titled “How do I turn cookies off?” below.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Functionality Cookies</h2>

        <p>We may use functional cookies that allow us to remember choices you have made on the site so as to provide you with a more enhanced user experience by delivering content specific to your interests.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Strictly Necessary Cookies</h2>

        <p>These are cookies that are required for the administration and operation of our site. Some cookies that we use are necessary for our site to function properly and to enable you to move around the site and use its features.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Third Party Cookies</h2>

        <p>Because DEVERO and Alex have a strong presence on various social networks, we try and make it as easy as possible to share content and to see what content is popular on those networks. We add buttons to allow people to easily share to those networks. We also use Facebook to power the commenting functionality on the site. When we include these social 'plugins', it gives those sites the flexibility to use their own cookies. They can't read any cookies we set from DEVERO.io, and we can't read any cookies they set, but it lets them do the same kind of traffic measuring that we do on the rest of DEVERO.io, and it also lets them know whether you're logged into their site. For example, if you're logged in to Facebook, read a post by Alex Devero and want to make a comment, you can do that straight away without having to log in again - we never know whether you're logged in or not, as you communicate directly with Facebook, through their plugins on our site.</p>

        <p>Other sites and services (including, for example, advertising networks, providers of external services like web traffic analysis services and content recommendation engines) may also use cookies, over which we have no control. These cookies are likely to be analytical/performance cookies or targeting cookies.</p>

        <p>As at 9th October 2017, we use the following third party cookies:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>MailChimp - Email distribution</li>
          <li>Google Analytics - Web Analytics</li>
          <li>Google Tag Manager - Tag Manger</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">How do I turn cookies off?</h2>

        <p>If you do not wish us to install cookies or you don't agree with how we use these cookies, you can change the settings on your internet browser to reject them. For more information please consult the “Help” section of your browser or visit www.aboutcookies.org,  www.allaboutcookies.org or http://optout.aboutads.info/#/. Please note that if you do set your browser to reject cookies, you may not be able to use all of the features on our site.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">What information do we collect if you sign up for our newsletter?</h2>

        <p>If you want to sign up to receive our newsletter we will collect personal information from you as is necessary for the newsletter service, namely your email address, name and what you are interested in hearing more about.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Will we use your information for marketing?</h2>

        <p>Once you have given your consent to marketing, we may display offers, promotions, products or services on the site which we think will interest you based upon the information we collect from your cookies. You may withdraw your consent to direct marketing at any time by writing to <a href="mailto:hello@devero.io">hello@devero.io</a> with the subject line ‘Withdraw consent request from direct marketing'.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">How else will we use your information?</h2>

        <p>We may also use your information for the following purposes:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>To help us make the website and other related content available to you (please see the "Will we share your information with anyone else?" section below for more information)</li>
          <li>To make the website more relevant for you and our other visitors. This includes sometimes requesting personal information from you to help us run and develop our website and associated functions</li>
          <li>To send you our newsletter if you have signed up to receive it</li>
          <li>To carry out occasional surveys to analyse our user base — ultimately we want to ensure that DEVERO.io provides everything that you — our audience — is looking for</li>
          <li>To check whether you are eligible for a competition and to contact you if you win</li>
          <li>To comply with the law</li>
          <li>As we feel is necessary to prevent illegal activity or to protect our interests</li>
          <li>How long do we keep hold of the information?</li>
        </ul>

        <p>There are certain reasons that we have to keep hold of some of your information. Naturally we keep your information while you are registered with us so that we are able to provide the service to you but we also keep it after you've left us, though only for as long as we need it. How long we keep it depends very much on the type of information we are holding and the purpose for which we need it. We also have to take into account our legal obligations in respect of how long we keep that data.</p>

        <p>You can request that we delete your personal information at any time.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Will we share your information with anyone else?</h2>

        <p>Only if...</p>

        <ul>
          <li>You specifically request this, such as when you submit information to enquire about jobs or submit a job application through www.devero.io</li>
          <li>We are required to do so to comply with the law or with the directions of the courts or other authorities</li>
          <li>We feel it is reasonably necessary to prevent illegal activity or to protect our interests</li>
          <li>We feel that other DEVERO companies products and services may interest you</li>
          <li>It helps our trusted third party service providers to provide and improve our service to you or to carry out surveys and user analysis to understand your needs and preferences. We will also share your information with MailChimp, who securely host emails and act as a supplier to distribute our newsletter. We contractually require these service providers to keep your personal information safe and secure. These trusted third parties would only be permitted to use your personal information for the purposes we specify.</li>
          <li>We currently don't share any info with third parties that is not anonymized. However, if we do in the future we will list them in this privacy policy and we will notify you of this change to our privacy terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We may share some broader statistics and customer profiling information with third parties and other DEVERO companies - but we'll keep it anonymous, so you won't be identifiable from that data.</p>

        <p>We will never rent or sell our user's details to any other organization or individual.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">What if you post information on our site?</h2>

        <p>This site contains an opportunity for users to comment ("User Content") on content displayed on the site. This information is in the public domain, so it may be accessed by any person using the web in any part of the world and can be found using independent search engines. So, if you choose to post information to the interactive parts of our site, we have to state that you do so at your own risk. This is the case whether the User Content is uploaded directly onto www.devero.io or through a connected site.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">This means your User Content:</h2>

        Won't have its usage and circulation limited as described in the sections of this policy above entitled 'Will we use your information for marketing?', 'How else will we use your information?' and 'Will we share your information with anyone else?'
        Won't be protected as described in the section of this policy below headed 'Will we be transferring any personal information outside the EU?'
        Won't be held securely as described in the section of this policy below headed 'Keeping your information safe'
        We are obliged by our legal eagles to state that, to the maximum extent permitted by law, neither DEVERO.io nor any other DEVERO company will be liable to you or to any third party for any loss or damage resulting from any User Content posted on www.devero.io.

        <p>However, if you upload User Content to our site using Facebook, we will protect your privacy consistently with your Facebook privacy settings.</p>

        <p>Please read our Terms and Conditions for more information about posting User Content. If you register on the site, you'll need to comply with our Terms and Conditions.</p>

        <p>If you have any concerns about User Content appearing on this site, please contact us using the Contact Us page on www.devero.io.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">How will we make sure our site is secure?</h2>

        <p>We follow strict security procedures to manage how your personal information is stored, used, who sees it and to help stop any unauthorized person getting hold of it. All personal information you register with DEVERO.io will be located behind a firewall. We take security extremely seriously but as no system is 100% secure, we can't completely guarantee the protection of your personal information, any more than any other organization can. So we can't accept any liability for the loss, theft or misuse of the personal information which you've registered on our website if there is a security breach.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Will we transfer any personal information outside the EU?</h2>

        <p>Countries outside the European Union may have a lower standard of protection for personal information than that required by EU data protection laws. The information we collect from you may be transferred to, and stored, outside the EU (including for example in the United States) and may also be processed by people operating outside the EU who work for us or one of our suppliers. If we need to transfer your data to a company based outside the EU (e.g. if our hosting company is based in the US), we'll take steps to make sure your personal data is handled in line with EU law. Please see the table of our suppliers in the "Will we share your information with anyone else?" section above which sets out whether they are based inside or outside the EU. If you would like any more details on this please get in contact with us.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">What about personal information relating to minors?</h2>

        <p>Protecting the online privacy of children is especially important to us. If you are under 18 years old, please do not provide us with your name, contact details or any other information about yourself. To find out more, please read our Terms and Conditions.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Are you protected by this policy outside www.devero.io?</h2>

        <p>www.devero.io contains links to other websites. Obviously, we don't have any control over those websites and we cannot take any responsibility for any information you give them. Other sites have different privacy and security policies and terms and conditions, so we advise you to read these before using them.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">How you can access your information</h2>

        <p>You can request access to the personal information we hold about you at any time. You can write to us at the following address requesting access to your personal information.</p>

        <p>Email: <a href="mailto:hello@devero.io">hello@devero.io</a></p>

You can also request that we correct any personal information which we hold about you where it is inaccurate.</p>

        <p>Sometimes we may ask you to provide proof of identity before we show you your personal information - so we can prevent unauthorized access.</p>
