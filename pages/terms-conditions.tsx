    <h2>Third Party Content</h2>

    <p>This site will contain some content which does not come from us, whether such content is posted by users or otherwise comes from anyone other than us (together, "Third Party Content").

    <p>We will include on the site Third Party Content that is personal opinion and political or controversial in its nature. These views do not necessarily reflect our views and we cannot accept any responsibility for those views.</p>

    <p>We may keep an eye on Third Party Content from time to time but please note that we have no obligation to police it. If we have any concerns, we may remove Third Party Content from the site with or without notice.</p>

You will not be able to submit any business proposals to us without agreeing to the terms and conditions of the Business Proposal Submission Agreement.</p>

    <h2>User Content</h2>

    <p>This site contains an opportunity for users to comment on articles and posts on the site ("User Content"). It is information in the public domain, so be aware that it may be accessed by any person using the web in any part of the world and can be found using independent search engines. So, if you choose to post information to the interactive parts of our site, we have to state that you do so at your own risk and that it won't be protected by us. So, we advise you to think carefully before choosing to share any personal information on the interactive parts of our site. For more information, please see our Privacy Policy.</p>

    <p>In order for our open forum to work, you the user must bear sole responsibility for the content which you post on the site and not post anything unless you have appropriate permission and authority to do so. By posting User Content, we have to assume that you are warranting that you have the permission and authority to do so and that, if at any point you no longer have that permission and authority, you will remove the User Content.</p>

    <p>In posting User Content to the site, you are basically granting to DEVERO.xyz an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, transferable licence to publish, display, copy, modify, create derivative works from and distribute the User Content on the site. You're also granting DEVERO.xyz the licence to use the User Content in any way for the purpose of publicizing the site as well as the products and services of DEVERO companies and also to grant sub-licenses on the same basis.</p>

    <p>We may keep an eye on User Content from time to time but please note that we don't have any obligation to police it. We may remove or block access to any User Content at any time. For example, we may do this where we reasonably believe that someone has broken the law, e.g. infringed a third party's intellectual property rights or breached a duty of confidentiality. We can bear no liability in respect of any loss or damage suffered as a result of any of these actions.</p>

    <p>The following section — User Code of Conduct — gives you our common sense guidelines for how to contribute to the site in order to avoid causing harm or offence to yourself and others and to avoid having your User Content removed.</p>

    <p>If you have any concerns about content appearing on this site, please click here to contact DEVERO.xyz.</p>

    <h2>User Code of Conduct</h2>

    <p>We are excited about customers and users being able to communicate with each other and share ideas. However, we want all our users to be able to feel safe and at ease whilst using our site. The best way of addressing this balance is to have a user code of conduct.</p>

    <p>By using our site you'll be agreeing to these Terms and Conditions including the Code of Conduct in this section.</p>

    <p>Our community is designed where possible to manage itself. Every comment left by a user can be rated and flagged by any other user. A user can positively, neutrally or negatively rate a comment. Also, a user can flag a comment as inappropriate or offensive by clicking a link that says "flag" next to each comment. Flagged comments may be reviewed by the moderators of DEVERO.xyz, who may remove those comments if they feel they are inconsistent with these Terms and Conditions.</p>

    <p>So if we believe that a user's behavior is likely to cause offence or harm to other users or to DEVERO, or is otherwise unacceptable, we may issue that user with a warning. In addition, we may need to remove any content which they have shared or posted up on the site. We will try to give that user warnings through the flag and probation system outlined above but we're not obliged to give the user that notice.</p>

    <p>To protect our users and the reputation of the site, we may keep an eye on the interaction between users from time to time but please note that we have no obligation to police it.</p>
