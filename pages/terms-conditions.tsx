We will indicate at the top of these Terms and Conditions when they were last updated.</p>

        <p>Please ensure that you check these Terms and Conditions regularly to view any changes which may have been made, because by continuing to use the site after these Terms and Conditions have changed, you will be confirming that you have read and understood, and agreed to be bound by, any revised Terms and Conditions.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Your Information and Privacy</h2>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Third Party Content</h2>

        <p>This site will contain some content which does not come from us, whether such content is posted by users or otherwise comes from anyone other than us (together, "Third Party Content"). Because of the open nature of the site, this Third Party Content is not approved by us. We have to state that any views expressed in such Third Party Content may not represent our views and that we shall not be responsible or liable for any Third Party Content or for the consequences of the use of it.</p>

        <p>We will include on the site Third Party Content that is personal opinion and political or controversial in its nature. These views do not necessarily reflect our views and we cannot accept any responsibility for those views.</p>

        <p>We may keep an eye on Third Party Content from time to time but please note that we have no obligation to police it. If we have any concerns, we may remove Third Party Content from the site with or without notice.</p>

        <p>If you have any concerns about content appearing on this site, please click here to contact DEVERO.io.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Business Proposal Submissions</h2>

        <p>If you wish to create a DEVERO business and submit a business proposal to DEVERO.io, that submission is subject to the particular terms and conditions of the “Business Proposal Submission Agreement” which we ask you to read and tick the tick-box indicating your agreement to those terms and conditions. You will not be able to submit any business proposals to us without agreeing to the terms and conditions of the Business Proposal Submission Agreement.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">User Content</h2>

        <p>This site contains an opportunity for users to comment on articles and posts on the site ("User Content"). It is information in the public domain, so be aware that it may be accessed by any person using the web in any part of the world and can be found using independent search engines. So, if you choose to post information to the interactive parts of our site, we have to state that you do so at your own risk and that it won't be protected by us. So, we advise you to think carefully before choosing to share any personal information on the interactive parts of our site. For more information, please see our Privacy Policy.</p>

        <p>In order for our open forum to work, you the user must bear sole responsibility for the content which you post on the site and not post anything unless you have appropriate permission and authority to do so. By posting User Content, we have to assume that you are warranting that you have the permission and authority to do so and that, if at any point you no longer have that permission and authority, you will remove the User Content.</p>

        <p>In posting User Content to the site, you are basically granting to DEVERO.io an irrevocable, perpetual, royalty-free, non-exclusive, worldwide, transferable licence to publish, display, copy, modify, create derivative works from and distribute the User Content on the site. You're also granting DEVERO.io the licence to use the User Content in any way for the purpose of publicizing the site as well as the products and services of DEVERO companies and also to grant sub-licenses on the same basis.</p>

        <p>We may keep an eye on User Content from time to time but please note that we don't have any obligation to police it. We may remove or block access to any User Content at any time. For example, we may do this where we reasonably believe that someone has broken the law, e.g. infringed a third party's intellectual property rights or breached a duty of confidentiality. We can bear no liability in respect of any loss or damage suffered as a result of any of these actions.</p>

        <p>The following section — User Code of Conduct — gives you our common sense guidelines for how to contribute to the site in order to avoid causing harm or offence to yourself and others and to avoid having your User Content removed.</p>

        <p>If you have any concerns about content appearing on this site, please click here to contact DEVERO.io.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">User Code of Conduct</h2>

        <p>We are excited about customers and users being able to communicate with each other and share ideas. However, we want all our users to be able to feel safe and at ease whilst using our site. The best way of addressing this balance is to have a user code of conduct.</p>

        <p>By using our site you'll be agreeing to these Terms and Conditions including the Code of Conduct in this section.</p>

        <p>Our community is designed where possible to manage itself. Every comment left by a user can be rated and flagged by any other user. A user can positively, neutrally or negatively rate a comment. Also, a user can flag a comment as inappropriate or offensive by clicking a link that says "flag" next to each comment. Flagged comments may be reviewed by the moderators of DEVERO.io, who may remove those comments if they feel they are inconsistent with these Terms and Conditions.</p>

        <p>So if we believe that a user's behavior is likely to cause offence or harm to other users or to DEVERO, or is otherwise unacceptable, we may issue that user with a warning. In addition, we may need to remove any content which they have shared or posted up on the site. We will try to give that user warnings through the flag and probation system outlined above but we're not obliged to give the user that notice.</p>

        <p>To protect our users and the reputation of the site, we may keep an eye on the interaction between users from time to time but please note that we have no obligation to police it.</p>

        <p>We cannot take responsibility or liability for the conduct of any person who uses our site. In addition, we are not responsible or liable for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the use of our site.</p>

        <p>We ask that in using this site you show respect for other users and the property of others.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Indemnity</h2>

        <p>Our legal eagles have said that we need to include this paragraph which basically protects DEVERO against people suing us for something bad happening:</p>

        <p>In using this site you agree to indemnify and hold harmless DEVERO.io and all other DEVERO companies, their subsidiaries and holding companies, the subsidiaries of their holding companies and each of their respective officers, directors, shareholders, employees, representatives and agents (and you shall continue to indemnify them and hold them harmless) in respect of all losses, liabilities, costs, claims, damages and demands suffered in connection with your conduct in using the site, your behavior towards us, other DEVERO companies, our and their representatives, other users, any breach of law, any breach of these Terms and Conditions or any breach of any third party's rights.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Proprietary Rights</h2>

        <p>All text, graphics, audio, video or image files, content, software, applications and information displayed on or available from this site, and all copyright, trade mark rights, design rights and other intellectual property rights in them (together, the "Proprietary Content") are the property of DEVERO.io, other DEVERO companies, our users, suppliers or licensors.

Our site also contains links to other third party websites, resources, advertisements or sponsorships.</p>

        <p>If you choose to access any of these links, you will be leaving DEVERO.io and since we don't have any control over these sites, we are not responsible for the content, advertising, products or services available from them, or for any dealings or disputes that you may have in relation to those sites. DEVERO.io is not liable for any loss or damage which may be suffered as a result of the use of such links and third party sites.

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Pop Ups</h2>

        <p>When using www.devero.io, you may get pop-ups occasionally. We use these for many reasons, like competition entry forms, signing up to our newsletters and questionnaires to help us improve our service to you. Pop-up boxes from DEVERO.io are clearly marked with a heading from DEVERO.io.</p>

        <p>You might also get pop-up boxes from other DEVERO companies. Again you should be able to identify these, as they should be marked with a heading from the relevant DEVERO company.</p>

        <p>You might also get pop-up ads from third parties. These may appear due to software you have installed, deliberately or unknowingly, on your computer. Unfortunately, DEVERO.io cannot control these pop-up boxes because they haven't come from us.</p>

        <p>We do not endorse any website or product which appears in any pop-ups which do not come from DEVERO.io. To read more about our cookie policy click here.</p>

        <h2 className="h4 mt-2">Other terms — a final word from our lawyers</h2>
